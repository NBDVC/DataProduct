Could be addressed in Re-engineering effort.\n\nExponential Growth\n========================================================\n- since the deployment of this app, traffic to CU2RealMadrid has exploded\n- Additional UI candy in the form of more sliders seen as true upgrade potential\n- More feature control will increase user traffic\n- Re-engineering requirements projected at 100 hours ~$15,000\n- We are really excited about this project and eager to get sta",
